## ATM Withdrawl Problem
### An ATM dispenses exactly Rs. 5000 per withdrawal using 100, 200 and 500 rupee notes. The ATM requires every customer to give her preference for one of the three denominations of notes. It then dispenses notes such that the number of notes of the customerâ€™s preferred denomination exceeds the total number of notes of other denominations dispensed to her.

### Example:<br />
for withdrawl of 2000<br />
Withdrawal 0 notes of 100<br />
Withdrawal 2 notes of 200<br />
Withdrawal 3 notes of 500<br />
Total Withdraw money is : 2000<br />
Remaining Amt in A/C is : 82000<br />
